# hello-world
First repository...

This is a way of starting. 

Until recently, I was a pigeon for Chicago restaurant magnates. Often, my hard work would be in the service of people who didn't really care and would easily pass it up. The whole idea is completely mundane. It's day to day work like any other, but always on display and for the service of others. One learns to smile through ones bordem and ennui quite easily. 

Regardless, I want to learn how to program, to develop, and to code. Part of me thinks that those last three words are all the same thing, but I'm hoping that there are differences, however minute, between all of those so that I don't sound like a complete moron. 

I want to work on front-end stuff to start. Web-development seems like a practical beginning. Also, I'm interested in react.js, considering how everything will continue to go mobile.
